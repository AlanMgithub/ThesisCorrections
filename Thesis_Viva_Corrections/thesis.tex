Cache coherency is the dominant mechanism for data sharing in commercial multiprocessor systems. Such mechanisms are complex to implement and can become costly (both power and performance) for larger systems.  Many cache coherency mechanisms, like directory-based approaches, aim to carefully coordinate data sharing, a distributed problem demanding a high volume of coherency messages to maintain order. 

This thesis explores an alternative approach, focused on the lifespan of data in caches, which can be monitored locally.  We demonstrate that this time-based coherency approach can be simpler to implement, requires no coherency messages, performs surprisingly well, and can be more efficient under appropriate circumstances.

The proposed time-based coherency approach is inspired by software oriented time-based coherency mechanisms. % and self-invalidating techniques used in some GPU caches. 
To thoroughly evaluate this approach, I have designed a multi-core version of the BERI processor, implemented on FPGA and supporting the FreeBSD operating system. Thus, a full system evaluation was made possible. A directory-based coherency scheme was also implemented to provide a baseline comparable with commercial approaches.

Cache coherency mechanisms have also been exploited to break security, since a malicious thread can interfere with the temporal properties of a program under attack. We demonstrate that time-based coherence can be tuned to make side-channel observations more challenging, which we believe can be used, together with other techniques, to mitigate side-channel attacks.

This dissertation is my own work and contains nothing which is the outcome of
work done in collaboration with others, except where specified in the text. This
dissertation is not substantially the same as any that I have submitted for a
degree or diploma or other qualification at any other university. This
dissertation does not exceed the prescribed limit of 60,000 words.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Simon Moore, for his incredible advice, guidance, and support throughout the course of my PhD. I also want to thank all the members of the CTSRD and MRC2 projects, for their moral, intellectual and engineering support. 
In particular, Robert Watson for his exceptional advice, and fantastic OS and engineering support;
Matthew Naylor, this dissertation would not be possible without his encouragement and incredible guidance on memory consistency;
Jonathan Woodruff, who is never short of fantastic architectural suggestions, engineering support, quick wit, and for designing the original BERI processor;
Alexandre Joannou, for all the heated discussions on cache coherence which have lead to some very interesting engineering solutions;
Brooks Davis, for all his work on OS support and debugging, certainly this dissertation would not be possible without it;
Stacey Son, for his excellent advice and software support;
Robert Norton, who can always answer a tricky question and for his technical support;
David Chisnall, for his advice and great compiler support;
Michael Roe, his work on testing has been incredibly important for all my multiprocessor work;
Theo Markettos, also known as the hardware guru, for his advice and support;
Nirav Dave, for all his advice in the early stages of coherence design;
Colin Rothwell, for his general advice and comedy of course;
Peter Neumann, for his historical perspective and good humour;
Andrew Moore, whose advice is always spot on;
The Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency, whose support of
the CTSRD and MRC2 projects was fundamental to the development of CHERI.

I also want to thank my close friends who have provided strong moral support throughout the course of this PhD. In particular, James Snee, Niall Murphy, Karthik Nilakant, Guilherme Frederico, Keri Wong, Tanika Mei, Catherine Kochmar, Chuen Yan Leung, Miranda Lewis, and Emily Thomas. Finally, I want to thank my entire family for supporting and encouraging me throughout the course of this PhD, especially, Ashok, Irina, and Anita Mujumdar.
