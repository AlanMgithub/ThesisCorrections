Clearing interrupt key so that ctrl-C will be sent to CHERI rather than stop
the nios2-terminal.  Kill the nios2-terminal by closing the window.
Tip - to make the terminal work (e.g. for vi), use:
  setenv TERM ansi
To mirror the MTL-LCD output on the nios2-terminal, use:
  watch -W ttyv0
nios2-terminal: connected to hardware target using JTAG UART on cable
nios2-terminal: "USB-BlasterII [9-1.1]", device 1, instance 1
nios2-terminal: (Use the IDE stop button or Ctrl-C to terminate)
